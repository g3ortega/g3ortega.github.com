I have always loved writing, perhaps because I also enjoy reading and I’ve realized how important it has been. Have found great books, at different stages of my life has greatly helped me to improve as person and to forge my thoughts and beliefs. Read blogs and opinions of people I admire has helped me to not settle and improve continuously. Now I want to start to build the habit of writing to give back a little of what I received and even better, to keep ideas, knowledge and opinions that I consider valuable and I would like to share and preserve.

So, I pretend to start with a post weekly. I going to write in english ‘cause I also need to improve a lot my writing skills in this language. The posts that will be published here will be also available in spanish in my blog. I’m thinking to start with a serie about software quality, because I am devoting more and more time and effort in this and I would like to share some challenges that I could face.
