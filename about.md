Well, of course I'm Gerardo Ortega :smile:

I graduated in Software Engineering. For several years, I have been developing web applications and lately starting with mobile using React Native. I see coding as craft. I am constantly pursuing self-improvement. I have experience with Ruby/Rails, JavaScript and Java. I have started to learn Elixir/Erlang, and to focus in ReactJS and React Native for clients in browsers and mobile devices.

I also have experience as SysAdmin: AWS (S2, S3, Route53, RDS, SNS, SES, ElastiCache...), server configurations, deploying workflow, integration of services. And finally, I love to play with data, I try to explore Data Science topics in my spare time.
