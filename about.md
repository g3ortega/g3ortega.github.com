I'm a Software engineer. Data Science enthusiast. Amateur trader.

Currently helping to build and expand the best travelers platform -aka [RoadGoat](https://www.roadgoat.com)- and the best platform for tennis playing -aka [playbycourt](https://playbycourt.com)-.

In my free time I like hiking, enjoy nature and reading books.

I've been working for startups for more than 5 years -[NuHome](https://www.nuhome.com.ni), [Recluta](https://recluta.com), [EthicsGlobal](https://ethicsglobal.com), etc-, and some upcoming projects.

I love open source and sometimes I contribute to some awesome projects -check my Github profile-.
