Currently helping to build and expand the best travelers platform on the planet -aka [RoadGoat](https://www.roadgoat.com)- and the best platform to play tennis -aka [playbycourt](https://playbycourt.com)-.

In my free time I like hiking, enjoy nature and reading good books.

I love open source and sometimes I contribute to some awesome projects -check my Github profile-.
